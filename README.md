# Advent of Code 2022 solutions

These are the Advent of Code 2022 Egel code solutions.

The daily input files are stored in `input.txt` files. Solutions
to the two tasks are often called `task1.eg` and `task2.eg`.


All scripts take their input from standard in. To run a 
script type `cat input.txt | egel taskx.eg`.
